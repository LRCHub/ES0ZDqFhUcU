Started in a timeless tradition
Still marking time
The wildest ambitions
Were just false alarms
In this mindless condition
I started to smile
But in time I was wishing
For nothing so wild

You gave me white wine and fried chicken
A new place to stay
Where my heart has permission
To sing all the day
And your smile is resistant
But starting to sway
Where the wild water's swimming
And leading us astray

We dream ourselves into a new position
And waste all the day
With our blues in remission
We'll keep them at bay
And in time's row permission
The clock fades away
I can hear its heart ticking
With nothing to say

You gave me white wine and fried chicken
A new place to stay
Where my heart has permission
To sing all the day
And your smile is resistant
But starting to sway
Where the wild water swimming
It leads us astray

Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la la

Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la la

Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la la

Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la la

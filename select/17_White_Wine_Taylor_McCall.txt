I've seen it all a thousand times
Won't be any different the second or third time
Around until the end
I gave up on trying to change your mind
Ashamed of the times I did try

The holy ghost lit a lonely fire
But I was never taught to love every minute of my life
It was almost gone when I first met you
But you stoaked the coals and you saved my life
Love was only for a moment
But I can still taste your lips
And the white wine

Looking back it was plain to see
The things that you we're trying to teach
I wasn't ready for
Fought like hell and I cursed your name
It took you leaving for me to know
Just how to lose that war

The holy ghost lit a lonely fire
But I was never taught to love every minute of my life
It was almost gone when I first met you
But you stoaked the coals and you saved my life
Love was only for a moment
But I can still taste your lips
And the white wine

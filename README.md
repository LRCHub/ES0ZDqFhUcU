> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I'm tired of making friends
They're everywhere we been
No one is half of what you are
I'm waiting for that call
White wine and Adderall
I mean, whatever turns you on
I know that you think
I'm useless
If I had you back,
I'd never lose it
I wanna get back into it
If I had you back,
I'd never lose it
I'd never lose it, no
Never lose it,
I'd never lose it, no
Never lose it,
I'd never lose it, no
Never lose it,
I'd never lose it
I know that you think
I'm useless
If I had you back,
I'd never lose it
I wanna get back into it
If I had you back,
I'd never lose it
I'd never lose it, no
You, you, you
No one, no one, no one
You, you, you
No one, no one, no one
We used to have it all
Your eyes were chemical
I need whatever turns you on
Tell me
I know that you think
I'm useless
If I had you back,
I'd never lose it
I wanna get back into it
If I had you back,
I'd never lose it
I'd never lose it, no
Never lose it,
I'd never lose it, no
Never lose it,
I'd never lose it, no
Never lose it,
I'd never lose it
I know that you think
I'm useless
If I had you back,
I'd never lose it
I wanna get back into it
If I had you back,
I'd never lose it
I'd never lose it, no
You, you, you
No one, no one, no one
You, you, you
No one, no one, no one
